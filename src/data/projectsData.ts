Each user has an individual account, and their balance is updated dynamically based on their recorded transactions. This ensures that everyone involved has clear visibility into their financial standing without the need for manual calculations or complex spreadsheets.", "There are two types of users in the system: Admins and Users. Admins have full control over financial management, including adding and managing users, recording expenses for individuals or groups, adding income for specific users, viewing complete transaction histories, editing or deleting transactions, and accessing detailed financial dashboards of all users. Regular users, on the other hand, can view their account balance and access their last ten transactions, allowing them to stay informed about their financial activities within the boarding.", "Currently, the app's backend is hosted on an on-premise server, providing reliable performance and secure data management. Based on user feedback, further improvements and updates will be made to enhance functionality and usability. Looking ahead, there are plans to release the app on both the Play Store and App Store after additional features are integrated, making expense tracking even more accessible and efficient for a wider audience.", "By offering a simple yet powerful solution for financial tracking in shared living spaces, the Boarding Expenses Tracking App eliminates the hassle of manual calculations and promotes transparency among residents.
